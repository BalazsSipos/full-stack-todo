# TODO POC

## Introduction

The Todo POC is a simple application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. With the app, users can create, update and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. It provides a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience for managing daily tasks. By default it shows only those tasks, where the start date is today or earlier.

You can try the app [here](https://full-stack-todo-sepia.vercel.app/).
